# Karat

A simple virtual machine.

This project has two major goals. The first is to write a small OS on top of Karat, 
and the other is to write a scripting language that compiles to karat. Because
of these goals, Karat will try to remain more like an assembly interpreter than
a high-level bytecode interpreter (not the JVM, Python VM, etc.).

### Building ###
Build entire project:
`make`

Build interpreter:
`make karat`

Build default modules:
`make modules`

### Preprocessor Flags ###
#### KDEBUG ####
Keep debug code in
#### KARAT\_PROD ####
Turn off some safety checks for production
